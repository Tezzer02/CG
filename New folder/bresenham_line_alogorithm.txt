Certainly! Here's a step-by-step explanation of the Bresenham's circle drawing algorithm:

1. Start by defining the center coordinates of the circle `(center_x, center_y)` and its radius.

2. Initialize the starting point of the circle's boundary. Set `x` to 0 and `y` to the radius.

3. Calculate the initial decision parameter `d` using the formula `d = 3 - 2 * radius`.

4. Enter a loop that continues until `x` becomes greater than `y`. This loop iterates over each pixel on the circle's boundary.

5. Within each iteration of the loop, plot points in the eight octants of the circle using symmetry. The octants are determined by adding or subtracting the current values of `x` and `y` to the center coordinates.

6. Update the decision parameter `d` based on the Bresenham's algorithm conditions:
   - If `d` is less than 0, increment it using `d += 4 * x + 6`.
   - If `d` is greater than or equal to 0, increment it using `d += 4 * (x - y) + 10` and decrement `y` by 1.

7. Increment `x` by 1 to move to the next pixel along the circle's boundary.

8. Repeat steps 5-7 until the condition `x <= y` is no longer satisfied. At this point, the entire circle has been drawn.

9. The algorithm is complete.

It's important to note that the above algorithm assumes integer coordinates. Additionally, the `plot` function mentioned in the previous code explanation should be replaced with the actual drawing or plotting function suitable for your specific environment or library.
